Employee Management System Project
The Final Project for this course is an accumulation of previous weeks’ assignments in which you will utilize all of the skills you have acquired in this course to develop an employee management system using Python programming language. In each week of the course, you created various functionalities of an employee management system. Now you will combine all the functionalities you have developed into one single application.

Your work will reflect on what you have learned about computer programming during this course, including topics such as variables and expressions, data type and branching, loops and functions, list and dictionary, exception and files.

You must include the following components in your Employee Management System:

Employee Management System – Functionality 1

In Week 1, you developed the first functionality for the employee management system. You wrote a Python script to allow users to enter the following string values: employeeName, employeeSSN*, employeePhone, employeeEmail, and employeeSalary.

To complete this section, incorporate the instructor feedback you received for your Week 1 Assignment and provide an updated screen shot of this functionality, along with the description of the functionality.

Employee Management System – Functionality 2

In Week 2, you developed the second functionality of the employee management system in which you allowed users to enter information for five employees at the same time.

To complete this section, incorporate the instructor feedback you received for your Week 2 Assignment and provide an updated screen shot of this functionality, along with the description of the functionality.

Employee Management System – Functionality 3

In Week 3, you developed the third functionality of the employee management system. You made use of looping to allow your Python script to run constantly. You then separated functionality 1 into two functionalities – “Add Employee” and “View all Employees”. Finally, you utilized global variables to develop a counter that keeps track of the number of employees in the system.

To complete this section, incorporate the instructor feedback you received for your Week 3 Assignment and provide an updated screen shot of this functionality, along with the description of the functionality.

Employee Management System – Functionality 4

In Week 4, you developed the fourth functionality of the employee management system. You improved the “View all Employees” functionality that was developed in Week 3 and added two new functionalities to your employee management system – “Search employee by SSN” and “Edit employee information.”

To complete this section, incorporate the instructor feedback you received for your Week 4 Assignment and provide an updated screen shot of this functionality, along with the description of the functionality.

Employee Management System – Functionality 5

In Week 5, you added two new functionalities to your Employee Management System – “Export employees’ information to text file” and “Import employee’s information from text file.”

To complete this section, incorporate the peer and/or instructor feedback you received for the two new functionalities. Provide an updated screen shot of this functionality and the description of the functionality.

Final Deliverable

You will now combine all the functionalities you have developed into one single application. Explain the steps you took to combine all of the functions into one single application, and provide a screen shot of the final Employee Management System.

The end product should look similar to the following:

------------------------ Employee Management System ---------------------------

There are ( 5 ) employees in the system.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1: Add new employee
2: View all employees
3: Search employee by SSN
4: Edit employee information
5: Export employee information into a text file
6: Import employee information from a text file
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please enter your option number:

Once you have completed the Employee Management System, you must provide the following in a Word document and submit it through the Waypoint grading system:

Screen shots of all of the functionalities of the Employee Management System, along with their descriptions.
An explanation of the steps you took to combine all of the functions into one single application.
A brief description of the purpose of the Employee Management System.
The script for the final Employee Management system.
Next, submit the zip folder that contains the running source code for the final project to the Week 5 Zip File Submission page. If you need more guidance, review the Zip File Quick Start GuidePreview the document. Be sure that you are sharing the zip folder with your instructor only. Your instructor will run your source code to ensure that the Employee Management System runs correctly.

Good job Jesse. Your program addresses most of the assignment requirements. Please see the attached code for an alternate solution. To showcase your work and to help to demonstrate your skills to prospective employers in the future it's important to have a beautifully presented portfolio. A portfolio is a compilation of academic work assembled for the purpose of evaluating learning progress, academic achievement, and it can set you apart from other applicants, whether in a professional or academic setting. Keep in mind that you should be featuring newer work as your skills and experience progress over time. Have faith in your work. Present them in the best way that you can and work hard to leave your audience with something unforgettable about your portfolio.
